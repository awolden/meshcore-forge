## Download

**ðŸ“¦ [Download the latest release](https://github.com/awolden/meshcore-forge/releases)**

Pre-built binaries available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### macOS Security Note
If macOS shows a security warning about the app being from an "unidentified developer":
1. Right-click the app and select "Open" (instead of double-clicking)
2. Click "Open" in the security dialog that appears
3. The app will then open normally on future launches

This is expected behavior for unsigned applications and is safe to bypass.
